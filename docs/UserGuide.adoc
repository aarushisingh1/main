== Introduction

RIMS (Resource and Inventory Management System) is a *command-line* logistic management system designed to manage an organisation’s facilities and inventory. It takes in user commands to *track the booking and loaning out of an organisation’s resources*. It is designed for logistics managers and executives aspiring to streamline and digitise the accounting  of their inventory. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `rims.jar` link:{repoURL}[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your local RIMS.
.  In your home folder for RIMS, create a directory called `data`, and in the `data` folder, create two text files:
`resources.txt` and `reserves.txt`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The UI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`list`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show you a list of all the resources with their status (booked/reserved/available).

.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all resources and their status (booked/reserved/available)
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features, Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

*Command Format*

* Each command is executed by multiple consecutive user inputs. For every input, the user enters the information prompted by the RIMS user interface,
followed by entering kbd:[Enter] to move on to the next input required.
* The first input is the *command* or *action* requested by the user. +
e.g. `*return*` or `*add*`

* Words in `*UPPER_CASE*` are the *arguments* to be supplied by the user. +
