== Introduction

RIMS (Resource and Inventory Management System) is a *command-line* logistic management system designed to manage an organisation’s facilities and inventory. It takes in user commands to *track the booking and loaning out of an organisation’s resources*. It is designed for logistics managers and executives aspiring to streamline and digitise the accounting  of their inventory. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `RIMS.jar` link:{repoURL}[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`list`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show you a list of all the rooms and items with their status (booked/reserved/available).
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all items/rooms and their status (booked/reserved/available)

====
*Command Format*

* Each command is executed by multiple consecutive user inputs. For every input, the user enters the information prompted by the RIMS user interface,
followed by entering kbd:[Enter] to move on to the next input required.
* The first input is the *command* or *action* requested by the user. +
e.g. `*return*` or `*add*`

* Words in `*UPPER_CASE*` are the *arguments* to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. `*ROOM NAME*` is a parameter which can be a name of a room, such as `*seminar room 1*`.

====

==== Delete item/room: `delete`
Delete item(s) or room available for loan/booking in RIMS.

.*Format*:
. `delete /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY`
* If the item or room does not exist in RIMS, then the UI will send a message to inform the user.
* Quantity must be a positive integer.
* Quantity must be less than the total number of items available in RIMS, else it will be reduced to zero.

.*Examples*:
* `delete /item book /qty 5`
* `delete /room multi purpose sports hall`

=== Item/Room Status

==== Loan out item/book room: `lend`
Registers an item / room as having been lent out, and is unavailable for further loaning until it is returned.

.*Format*:
. `lend /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY /by DEADLINE`
. `lend /room ROOM /by DEADLINE`
* If the item or room does not exist in RIMS, then the UI will send a message to inform the user.
* Quantity must be a positive integer.
* Quantity must be less than the total number of items available in RIMS, else it will be reduced to zero.

.*Examples*:
* `delete /item book /qty 5`
* `delete /room multi purpose sports hall`

==== Return an item / room: `return`
Registers an item / room as having been returned, and is thus available to be loaned again.

.*Format*:
. `return /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY`
. `return /room ROOM`
* Quantity must be a positive integer.
* Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
* If the user attempts to return a room / a quantity of items that have not been borrowed, the UI will send an error message to the user.


.*Examples*:
* `return /item frisbee /qty 3`
* `return /room seminar room 1`

==== Reserve an item / room: `reserve`
Registers an item as having been reserved (loaned in advance) from a future date to another future date.

.*Format*:
. `reserve /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY /from DATE /to DEADLINE`
. `reserve /room ROOM /from DATE /to DEADLINE`
* While loans take effect from the current date to a specified deadline, reservations specify a future time-frame for an item to be loaned out.
* Quantity must be a positive integer.
* If the user requests a quantity that is greater than the existing amount of that item in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
* If the item or room does not exist in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
* Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
* Deadline must be formatted dd/mm/yyyy hhmm in 24-hour time format.

.*Examples*:
* `reserve /item basketball /qty 1 /from 01/10/2019 2300 /to 03/10/2019 2300`
* `reserve /room basketball court /from 01/10/2019 2300 /to 03/10/2019 2300`

==== Extend existing loan of an item / room: `extend`
Extends the loan period of an item/room that is currently loaned out.

.*Format*:
. `extend /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY /by DEADLINE`
. `extend /room ROOM /by DEADLINE`
* Quantity must be a positive integer.
* Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
* Deadline must be formatted dd/mm/yyyy hhmm in 24-hour time format.
* If the extended deadline as specified by the user is not a date later than the current deadline, the UI will send an error message to the user.

.*Examples*:
* `extend /item basketball /qty 1 /by 05/10/2019 2300`
* `extend /room basketball court /by 06/10/2019 0000`

==== Reminders
Reminds user about items or rooms due within a specific period of time, upon starting up RIMS.

==== Saving data
With the execution of any command, any changes in data on items, rooms and their statuses will be updated on external text files (`.txt`) within the hard drive, to ensure data persistence and retention even after termination of RIMS. Saving manually is not required.
